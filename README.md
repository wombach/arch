# arch
architect extra files

these are files in the cofiguration directory
The standard configuration directory is
D:\program\Bizzdesign\architect\configuration\MetaModels

To make configurations loaded with every restart you have to copy this directory to a different location. In my case 
D:\Local\bizzdesign\configurations\configuration_whr\

There you can then add files etc. 

To activate the new configuration directory you have to change Application Settings in Architect.
-> Options -> Application Settings -> Configuration
see settings in ApplicationSettings.jpg file
